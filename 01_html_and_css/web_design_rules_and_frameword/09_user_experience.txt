     Design is how it works" -Steve Jobs-

      beautiful 
    - UX is experience with interface, UX design is what makes an 
      interface useful and functional 
    - UX design can not exist without UI design 


UX Design Guiding principles:
-----------------------------
    -  A website or application exists for a reason: a user has a 
        goal for visiting it, and a business has a goal for creating it

    UX Example:
    - hilighting an option in the product pricing table: 
        - helps the user decide faster what is the best option
        - helps the business maximize revenue



User Experinece Rules for usability:
--------------------
    01) Don't desing complicated layouts. Don't reinvent the wheel.
        Use patterns that users know.

    02) Make your call-to-action the most prominent element, and make 
        the text descriptive

    03) Use blue text and underlined text only for links!

    04) animations should have a purpose and be fast: between 
        200 and 500 milliseconds

    05) In forms, align labels and fields in a single vertical line, 
        to make the form easier to scan

    06) Offer users good feedback for all actions: form errors, 
        form success, etc [web app]

    07) Place action buttons where they will create an effect (law of 
        locality)

User Experinece For Website Content:
------------------------------------

    08) Use a descriptive, keyword-focused headline on your main page.
        Don't vague or fancy!

    09) ONly include relevant information, efficiently! Cut out fluff
        and make the content 100% clear

    10) Use simple words! Avoid technical jargon and "smart-sounding" 
        words

    11) Break up long text with sub-headings, images, block, quotes,
        bullet points, etc.
