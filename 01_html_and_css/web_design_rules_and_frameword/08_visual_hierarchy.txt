What is Visual Hierarchy?
-------------------------
    ** Visual Hierarchy is about establishing which elements of a
        design are the most important ones 

    ** Visual Hierarchy is about drawing attention to these most 
        important elements
        
    ** Visual Hierarchy is about defining a "path" for users, to 
        guide tehm through the page 

    ** we use a combination of Position, size, colors, spacing, borders,
        and shadows to establish a meaningful visual hierarchy between 
        elements/components


Visual Hierarchy fundamentals:
-----------------------------
    01) Position important elements closer to the top of the page.
        where they get more attention 

    02) Use images mindfully, as they draw a lot of attention (larger 
        images get more attention)

    03) Whitespace creates seperation, so use whitespace strategically
        to emphasize elements


Visual hierarchy for text elements:
-----------------------------------
    04) for text elements, use font size, font wieght, color, and 
        whitespace to convey importance

    05) What text elements emphasize? Titles, sub-titles, links, buttons
        data points, icons
        => you can also de-emphasize less important text, like labels or
            secondary/ additional information
        => title, sub-title, link, icon, data point, additional information


Visual hierarchy between components:
------------------------------------
    06) emphasize an important component using background color, shadow
        or border (or multiple)

    07) Try emphasizing some component A over component B by 
        demphasizing component background
    
    08) What components to emphsize? 
            Testimonials, 
            call-to-action sections, 
            highlight sections, 
            preview cards, 
            forms, 
            pricing tables, 
            important rows/ columsn in tables, 
            etc... 


implementing in our project:
----------------------------
    - the heading should be closer to its section
    - in the card the li should have less space between each other
    - and the li in card should be farther from the from the action
