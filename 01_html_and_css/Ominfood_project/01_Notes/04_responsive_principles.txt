Responsive Design:
    - Design technique to make a webpage adjust its layout and visual 
        styles to any possible screen size (windows or viewport size)

    - in practice, this means that Responsive design makes websites usable on
        all devices, such as desktop computers, tables, and mobile phones

    - it's a set of practices, not a separate technology. It's all just CSS


- Responsive Design Ingredients:
------------------------------
1) Fluid layouts
    - To allow webpage to adapt to the current viewport width 
        (or even height)

    - Use % (or vh / vw) unit instead of px for elements that should 
        adapt to viewport (usually layout)

    - use max-width instead of width



2) Responsive units
    - Use rem unit instead of px for most length

    - to make it easy to scale the entire layout down (or up) automatically

    - helpful trick: 
        setting 1rem to 10px for easy calculations



3) flexible images
    - by default, images don't scale automatically as we change the 
        viewport, so we need to fix that 

    - always use % for image dimensions, together with the max-width



4) media queries
    - bring responsive sites to life!

    - to change CSS styles on certain viewport widths
        called breakpoints




Desktop-first vs. Mobile-first development:
-------------------------------------------
Desktop-first: 
    - start writing CSS for the desktop: large screen.

    - them media queries shrink design to smaller screens.


Mobile-first: 
    - start writing CSS for mobile devices: small screen.

    - then, media queries expand design to a large screen.

    - forces us to reduce websites and apps to the absolute essentials
