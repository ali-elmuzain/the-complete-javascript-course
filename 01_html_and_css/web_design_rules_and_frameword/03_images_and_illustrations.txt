## Use Good Images:

    01) Different types of images:
        product photos, storytelling photos, illustrations, patters

    02) Use images to support your website's message and story.
        So only use relevant images!

    03) Prefer original images. If not possible use original looking
        stock images (not generic ones)
        ** toolBox:
            - Unsplash
            - pexels
            - drawkit
            - undraw

    04) Try to show real people to trigger user's emotions

    05) If necessary, crop images to fit your messages

    06) experiment combining photos, illustrations and patterns

## Handling Text on images:

    07) Method #1: Darker or birghten image (completely or partially, using a gradient)

    08) Method #2: Position text into neutral image area:
        - you should be careful because it could change postion on other view port

    09) Method #3: Put text in a box

## Some technical details:

    10) To account for high-res screens, make image dimensions 2x
        as big as their display size
        - scale factor:
          actual pixels the screen contains / Pixels represent on screen

        - On high-res screens, scale factor is 2x or even 3x, on "normal"
          screens it's just 1x (1 physical pixel = 1 design pixel)

    11) Compress images for a lower file size and better performance:
        - squoosh

    12) When using multiple images side-by-side, make sure they have the exact same dimensions
