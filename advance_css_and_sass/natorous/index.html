<!-- 
 What we will learn in here 
    - The best way to peroform the basic reset using the 
      universal selector
    - How to set project-wide font definitions
    - hwo to clip parts of elements using clip-path
-->
<!-- 
Notes:
    - we don't just select the element and set the property 
      on it, we give it a class  and set the property to that class

normalize:
    - in css we use the universal selector, in order to make a cross browser reset
    - now this is not neccessary becasue all the browser getting betters.

font property of the entire page: 
    - should be set in the body (inheritance)


background-size: cover;
    - makes the background image cover the entire element
    - what ever the width of the viewport,it will always try to fit
    
position: top;
    - ensure what ever the viewport size is that this top of the image 
        is in the top
    - bottom, center, ... it will cropoed out depending on that 

to specify griedient:
    - we always use background image (not sure)
    - background-image: linear-gradient(to right bottom, color1, color2), url()

clip-path: polygon(x1 y1, x2 y2, x3 y3, x4 y4);
    - axis are relative to the element's top left corner
    - x1 y1 is the top left corner
    - x2 y2 is the top right corner
    - x3 y3 is the bottom right corner
    - x4 y4 is the bottom left corner

logo;
    - it is better to put the img of logo in dive because it is an inline element
    - alt attribute is to describe the image for SEO

for heading text;
    - h1  have main and sub heading and change the stye 
    - best thing to make them next to each other is to make them block 
    - sub, main => display block  
    - give the main heading letter spacing 35

for the position: 
    - it will determine depending on the position of the element
    - top, bottom, left, right
    - but we need to make it depending ot the center 
    - transofrm: translate(x, y);=> translate(-50%, -50%);

<!-- 
 CSS animation using @keyframes and the animation property

@keyframes name { <from>   0%{} - <to> 100% {} }

    transfrom: transformX   => from left to right 

to the animation to work use this property;
    - animation-name: name;
    - animation-duration: time;
    - animation-delay: time; 
        =>  it mean it will wait this time before animation start
    - animation-iteration-count: number;
        => that mean animation will iterate this number of counts
    
    - animation-timing-function : linear, ease, ease-in, ease-out, ease-in-out
        => how the animation should proegress over the duration of each cycle

shorten property
    animation => animation-name, animation-duration, animation-delay, animation-iteration-count, animation-timing-function
        => css will figure what mean whats


backface-visibility: hidden;  (proprety)
    - to prevent the animation from moving to the top like we notice 
    - to ensure that backpart actually hidden


rotate(degree)

scale(x, y)
    - to increase the size

animation fill mode: backwards:
    - automatically start the styleys up to zero percent before the animation starts

what we are going to learn 
    - pseudo elements and pseudo classes
    - how and why ot use the ::after pseudo element
    - how to create a creative hover animation effect using the transition

our button here will be a ancher elememnt:


transition: 
    -

when hover;
    - transform: translateY(-3px);
    - box-shadow: 0 10px 20px (0,0,0,0.2);

when clicking 
    - increase the translateY 
    - decrese the box shadow to the half


after pseuedo elements:
