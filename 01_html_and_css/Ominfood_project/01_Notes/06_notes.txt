1) selected by classes:
    - Even if you can apply styles using element selectors, 
      itâ€™s better to use classes for styling.


2) link or button:
    - use links for navigation and buttons for actions


3) layout tools to follow:
    - Maintain consistent tool conventions across the 
      entire layout whenever possible


4) for SEO:
    - use alt with images 



6) allow the style to take it time: 
    - add in the main rule --> transition: property
        - select the element you want to animate 
        - and the time it want to animate
    - you can specify one decoration to transition
    - put transition on the original "state"


7) important style:
    - when builing your library you might need !important in some cases


8) grid or flex with 1-dimentional layouts:
    - Use a grid layout when precise sizing is important; 
      otherwise, opt for flexbox.
    - even if it have one element you can set it to flex and adjust 
      it 

      
9) to make the square a circle :
    - border radious: 50%


10) height and width:
    - why selecting a width an not make it automatically adjusted
    => because there is some bug in the sefari browser when the
       images are flex items and so we need to set both height and 
       width in that case 


11) nav elements:
    - is a semantic elements which is used for major navigation blocks
    - so not all collection of links need to be wrapped in a nav


12) main element:
    - is the main area of a web document. 
    - it contain the main part of the web page 
    - You can wrap the entire section with the <main> element to 
      designate it as the primary content of the page 
    - However if the same section appears on multiple page it should 
      not be marked as the main content 


13) Why set a specific height for the header instead of allowing 
    the content and padding to define it naturally
    - because we might make the navigation sticky a bit later 


14) hero section
    - sometimes the hero section is much more bigger than other section 
      in the width



//  sections
1) it is not a good choice to have an h3 above of h2 
   - cause h3 is used to describe this h2 is all about 

2) in one section you can have multi containers div 
   
4) if the title not subtitle of the bigger title 
    - you can use paragraph like in meal case 

5) how add category 
    - categories are many times a good fit for using tags 
    - so you can add before the title 



// Tricks:

1) How to add border inside:
    - by using box-shadow 
      only scale it and inset

2) How to add height if the height property doesn't work:
    - by adding padding-bottom

3) filtering img to gray 
    - fileter grayscale(100%)

 - grid-2-cols => grid-template-columns: rpeat(2,1fr);
 - grid-4-cols => grid-template-columns: rpeat(4,1fr);

for accessibility:
 - check the constract between text and background color
