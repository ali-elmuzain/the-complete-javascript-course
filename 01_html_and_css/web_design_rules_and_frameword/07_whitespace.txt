Why Whitespace:
-----------
** The right amount of whitespace makes designs look clean, modern and
    polished **

    01) Use tons of whitespace between sections
        ex: 192px between sections or 140px, etc

    02) Use a lot of whitespace between groups of elements
        ex: 24px, 96px, 152px, etc
        vertically we need a lot more space than horizontally

    03) Use whitespace between elements 

    04) Inside groups of elements, try to use whitespace instead 
        of lines

How Much Whitespace:
--------------------

    05) The more some elements (or groups of elements) belong together,
        the closer they should be!
        => the raw of porximity:
            ex: title and text belong together so there is less space 
                between them, while we have a more space between them 
                and the icons related to them 

    06) Start with a lot of whitespace, maybe even too much! Then
        remove whitespace form there
        => be aware that: too much whitespace look detached, too 
           little looks too crammed

    07) Match other design choices. If you have big text or big icons, 
        you need more whitespace.

    08) Try a hard rule, such as using multiples of 16px for all spacing
        => 2, 4, 8, 12, 16, 24, 32, 48, 64, 80, 96, 128px
