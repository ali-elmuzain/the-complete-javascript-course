              A healthy meal delivered to your door, every single day

              We are a technology company first, but with a major focus on
              consumer well-being through a healthy diet. Most people are very
              busy with their jobs, family and friends, and other important
              activities, which doesn't leave much time for cooking. This might
              lead to a poor diet and lasting health consequences. We want to
              solve this problem by using an AI-centric approach. Users can use
              our app to select their diet and foods they like and dislike, and
              our AI algorithm will create a custom and individual weekly meal
              plan. But we don't stop there. We partner with restaurants and
              other cooking partners to actually cook and deliver all meals from
              the generated meal plans, in selected cities. All this will be
              packed up in a monthly subscription, where users can choose
              between receiving one or two meals per day, every single day of
              the month
