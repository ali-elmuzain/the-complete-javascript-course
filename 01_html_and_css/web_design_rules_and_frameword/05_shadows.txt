Some concepts first:
--------------------
    ** After an era of 100% flat design, we're now back to using shadows
     in UI design ("flat design")

    ** Shadow creates depth (3D): the more shadow, the further away
       from the interface the element is 


Use Good Shadows:
----------------
    01) You don't have to use shadows! Only use them if it makes sense
        for the website personality
        => less shadow make it serious and elegant 
        => more shadow meke it playful/fun

    02) Use shadows in small doses: don't add shadows to every element!

    03) Go light on shadows, don't make them too dark!


Use Shadows in the right situation:
-----------------------------------
    04) Use small shadows for smaller elements that should stand out
        (to draw attention)

    05) Use medium-sized shadows for larger areas that should stand 
        out a bit more 

    06) Use large shadows for elements that should really float above 
        the interface

    07) Experiment with changing shadows on mouse interaction 
        (click and hover)

    08) experiment with glows (colored shadows)
