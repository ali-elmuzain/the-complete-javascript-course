Border radious: 
--------------
    01) use border-radius to increase the playfulness and fun of the 
        design, to make it less serious
            - the less border radious => the more serious and elengant 
            - the more border-radius  => the more playful / fun 

    02) Typefaces have a certain roundness: make sure that 
        border-radious matches that roundness!

    03) Use border-radius on buttons, images, around icons, 
        standout sections and other elements
