properties:
  floats:
    left, right;

note:
 - when usign float for the element it will get complotly out of
   the page flow;
    
 - so the area that the parent talked pecause of it child element 
   it will be lost so you should use, the 'collapsing' 
   => overflow hidden 


cleaning float:
---------------
 - add block elemnent with clear class for example  after the dive we want 
   to clear:
 - add clear property to that class 
    clear:both;
 - instead of doing that you can use after psuesdo class and make it 
   display block 
 - note:
    in case there is a block element after it so don't use this trick 
    and clear it directly 



normal flow vs. absoulute float vs. floats:
-------------------------------------------
Normal float:
    - default positioning 
    - element is 'in flow'
    - elements are simply laid out according to their
      order in the HTML code.
    - default positioning: 
            position: relative;

absoulute positioning:
    - elements is removed from the normal flow: 'out of flow'
    - no impact on surrounging elements, might overlap them 
    - we use top, bottom, left, or right to offset the element
      from its relatively positioned container 
    - position: 
        absoulute;


Floats:
    - Element is removed from the normal flow: 'out of flow'
    - text and inline elements will wrap around the floated element
    - the container will not adjust its height to the element
    - float:
        left, right;
