How Rem and max width works:


1) max width:
    - when there is no more additional space to fit then element should simply
        have the width of the parent container

    - max-width: 1000px;
        it mean it will fit the parent elemtn until it getting bigger 
        than 1000px, in this case it will take the 1000px width 
    
    - while if you using the width it will make it static


2) rem 
    - root element font size 

    - root of the document is the html element 

    -  1 rem = 16px => which is the default browser font size 
        unless the user change it, then it will take diff value


Note:
    - some time we set the value of max width with rem  
        so when changing the font size of smaller or bigger screen the 
        layout will chrunk or grow depending on the font size of rem
    
    - not perfect => because the user may change (solve)
        to solve that you can set it to percentage value 

    - how to change the rem 
        html {font-size: 10px}
        html {font-size: 62.5%}

    - all the relative units such as percentages or rem needs to converts
        back to pixels (browser will do that)
