Choose the right color:
----------------------
    01) Make the main color match your website's personality:
        colors conver meaning 
    02) Use a good color tone! Don't choose a random tone 
      or CSS named colors
        * toolbox => 
                Open color, 
                tailwindcss, 
                flat UI colors 2
                palleton
                coolors
                tint and shade generator

    03) You need at least 2 types of colors in your color palette:
        a main color and a grey color (it doesn't mean gray it could 
        be dark blue what we mean the gredient of gray)

    04) With more experince, you can add more color: accent colors (use 
      tool)

    05) for diversity, create lighter and darker "versions" 
       (tints and shades)


when and How to use colors: 
---------------------------
    06) Use main color to draw attention to the most important
       elements on the page 
    
    07) Use colors to add interesting accesnts or make entire components
       or sections stand out 

    08) You can try to use your color strategically in images 
       and illustrations

Colors and Typography:
----------------------
    09) On dark colored backgrounds, try to use a tint of the background
       ("lighter version") for text

    10) Text should usually not to be completely black.
        Lighten if up it looks heavy and uninviting

    11) Don't make text too light! Use a tool to check contrast between 
        text and background colors:
        ** contrast ratio needs to be at least 4.5:1 for normal text 
        and 3:1 for large text (18px+)  (use coolors)
