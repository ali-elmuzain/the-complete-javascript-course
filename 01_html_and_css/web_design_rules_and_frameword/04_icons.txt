Use Good Icons:
---------------
    01) Use a good icon pack, there are tons of free and paid icons pack
        toolbox:
        - phosphor icons
        - ionicons
        - icons8
        - font awesome

    02) Use only one icon pack. Don't mix icons from different icon packs

    03) Use SVG icons or icon fonts. Don't use bitmap image format (.jpg
        and .png)
            - svg => vector based 
              scale indefinitely

    04) Adjust to website personality! Roundness, weight and filled/
        outlined depend on typography

When using icons:
---------------------------

    05) Use icons to provide visual assistance to text 

    06) Use icons for product feature blocks

    07) Use icons associated with actions, and label them (unless no
        space or icon is 100% clear)
        - don't use some elements as text and other as unlabeled icons
          

    08) Use icons as bullet points

Use Icon well :
---------------

    09) To keep icons neutral, use same color as text. To draw more
        attention, use different color 

    10) Don't confuse your users: icons need to make sense and fit the 
        text or action!

    11) Don't make icons larger than what they were designed for. If
        If needed, enclose them in a shape 


implementing:
-------------
    - there are many way to implementing svg icons 
        - you can download it then use it with img element
        - or you implement it like any codes becase svg is just a code
    - for svg icon when you want to style the color 
        - stroke property 
    - for the body of the svg you need use 
        - fill property 

trick:
    - you can copy multiple elements in different lines using "alt"
    - and then paste this multiple elements in one time
