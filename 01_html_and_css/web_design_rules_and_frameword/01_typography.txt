Some concepts first: 
--------------------

- Typography:
    Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written
    language legible, readable and appealing when displayed


- serif vs sans-serif:
    - serif typeface:
        - creates a traditional/ classic look and feel
        - converys trustworthiness
        - good for long text

    - sans-serif typeface
        - modern look and feel
        - clean and simple 
        - easier to choose for beginner designer:


Rules:
------
    1) Use only good and popular typefaces and play it safe;
        - sans serif: 
            ex: inter, open sans, roboto, montserrat, work sans, lato 
        - serif: 
            ex: merriweatherer, aleo, playfair display, cormorant, cardo
                laro 
        
    2) It's okay to use just one typeface per page! if you wnat more, 
       limit to 2 typefaces.

    3) choose the right typeface according to your website personality;
        - choose the right personality for your website
        - decide between a serif and sans-serif typeface
        - experiment with all the good typefaces
        - you can keep trying different typefaces as you design and build
     
    4) when choosing font-sizes, limit choices! use a type scale tool or
       other pre defined range:
       10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 30. 36, 44, 52, 62, 74, 86, 98px

    5) Use a font size between 16px and 32px for "normal" text

    6) for long text (like a blog post), try a size of 20px or even bigger

    7) for headline, you can go really big (50px+) and bold (600+), 
        depending on personality

    8) for any text, don't use a font weight under 400 (regular)

    9) Use less than 75 characters per line 

    10) for normal sized text, use a line height between 1.5 and 2. 
        for big text go below 1.5
            - the smaller or longer the text, the larger the line height 
              needs to be!

    11) Decrease letter spacing in headlines, if it looks unnatural
        this will come form experience 

    12) experiment with all caps for short titles. Make them small and 
        bold and increase letter-spacing

    13) usually don't justify text 

    14) Don't center long text blocks, small blocks are fine

    - if you are going to add a google font you should code the link
        before your style link
