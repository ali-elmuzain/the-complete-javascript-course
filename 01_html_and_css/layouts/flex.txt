What is flexbox?
----------------
 - Flexbox is a set of related CSS properties for building 1-dimentional
   layouts.

 - The main idead behind flexbox is that empty space inside a container 
   element can be automatically divided by its child elements

 - Flexbox makes it easy to automatically align items to one another 
   inside a parent container, both horizonatlly and vertically.

 - Flexbox solves common problems such as vertical centering and creating
   equal-height columns.

 - Flexbox is perfect for replacing floats, allowing us to write fewer
   and cleaner HTML and CSS code

 - Flexbox terminology:
    - flex container 
    - flex items 
    - main axis 
    - cross axis
