what is sass?
-------------
    sass is a css preprocessor, an extension of CSS that adds power
    and elegance to the basic language


how it works?
-------------
    - instead of writing css file with css code, we write a sass code with sass 
      files, then we run compiler and that compiler converts the sass code 
      into regular css 
    - the browser will not know that we had written our code with sass because 
      it will compiled to css code 


Main Sass features:
-------------------
    - Variables:
        for reusable values such as colors, font-size, spacing, etc
    
    - nesting:
        to nest selectors inside of one another, allowing us to write less code;

    - operators:
        for mathematical operations right inside of CSS

    - partials and imports: 
        to write CSS in different files and importing them all into 1 single file

    - mixin: 
        to write reusable pieces of css code;

    - functions:
        similar to mixins, with the difference that they produce a value that can
        then be used.

    - extends:
        to make different selectors inherit declarations that are common to all of them

    - control directives: 
        for writing complex code using conditionals and
